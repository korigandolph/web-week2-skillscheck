        <p class= 'text'>Elephants can produce a variety of sounds, which emanate from their trunk, mouth, forehead and chest. These sounds include roars, barks, clicks, purrs, rumbles and snorts, which are carried through the air. They can detect the airborne calls and recognize who is making them from a distance of 1 mile. Elephants can distinguish among the calls of family members as well as the contact calls of non-related groups.</p>
